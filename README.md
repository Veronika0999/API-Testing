# API Testing with Robot Framework


This repository is for my personal practice in API testing using Robot Framework. I'll be using this space to experiment with various API testing scenarios and sharpen my skills in automated testing.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to serve as my playground for learning and practicing API testing techniques with Robot Framework. I'll be creating, modifying, and executing test cases to gain hands-on experience in API testing.
